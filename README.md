# C++ Projects

This repository contains a collection of my C++ projects.

## Project List

**Features:**

* Generates random computer choices.
* Implements basic game logic with win/loss/tie conditions.
* Includes a time limit for player input.
* Tracks player and computer scores.

**How to Run:**

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the generated executable.

**Gameplay:**

1. The game will display a welcome message and a time limit.
2. The player selects an option (rock, paper, or scissors).
3. The computer generates a random choice.
4. The winner is determined and displayed.
5. The game continues until the player chooses to stop.

**Known Issues:**

* The time limit might not be perfectly accurate due to system performance.
* Error handling for invalid user input is not implemented.

**Future Improvements:**

* Implement more accurate time measurement.
* Add error handling for invalid input.
* Introduce different game modes or difficulty levels.

### How to Play
1. Run the compiled program.
2. The game board will appear.
3. Choose a spot (1-9) to place your 'X'.
4. The computer will then make its move.
5. The game continues until someone wins or it's a tie.

### Known Issues
